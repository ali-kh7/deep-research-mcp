Welcome to the **Deep Research MCP** repository! This project provides a server compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is designed to facilitate comprehensive web research. By utilizing Tavily's Search and Crawl APIs, the server gathers detailed information on various topics and structures this data to support high-quality markdown document creation using large language models (LLMs).

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it via the API. Here‚Äôs how to use it effectively:

1. **Send a request to gather information**:

   You can send a request to the server with a specific topic to gather data. The server will return structured information ready for markdown generation.

   Example request:

   ```http
   POST /api/research
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "topic": "Artificial Intelligence"
   }
   ```

2. **Receive structured data**:

   The server responds with data in a structured format. This data can be used directly or transformed into markdown documents.

3. **Generate markdown documents**:

   The structured data can be converted into markdown using the provided functions in the API.
